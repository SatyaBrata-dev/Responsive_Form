# Responsive_Form
I just completed a Responsive Registration Form using HTML and CSS!
Itâ€™s clean, mobile-friendly, and collects essential user details like:

âœ… Name
âœ… Email
âœ… Age (in words)
âœ… Gender
âœ… Image and PDF upload support
ðŸ“© Plus â€” users receive an automatic email confirmation after submitting the form!

ðŸ’» This project demonstrates how even simple frontend elements can offer smooth UX and professional design across devices.
